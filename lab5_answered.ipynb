    "This lab introduces the Rational Speech Act model, which is a way of doing Bayesian modelling of pragmatic inference and rational behaviour during communication. The RSA model is potentially very general, but here we are going to use it to model pragmatic word use, and see how pragmatic speakers and listeners can go beyond literal word use to facilitate communication. Our model of word meaning builds on the model we used in Lab 2; now we are going to move beyond single words to (very small!) lexicons, and model inference during communication rather than learning."

    "1. How do synonymy (several ways of expressing a given meaning) and ambiguity (several meanings expressed using the same signal) in the lexicon affect communication between literal speakers and literal listeners? How does the availability of pragmatic inference (i.e. moving up to s1 and l1) change the consequences of ambiguity? "

   "source": [
    "*The `small_lexicon` example illustrates these various points. Ambiguity is generally a problem, and especially so for literal speakers and listeners. For example, imagine a literal speaker attempting to convey referent 1 to a literal listener. The literal speaker uses word2, because that's what's specified in their lexicon. However, the literal listener will often interpret word2 as conveying referent 0 or referent 2, because it's ambiguous; as a result, they will fail to communicate about referent 1 most of the time (on average, two thirds of the time), and the same for referent 2. They also don't do great with referent 0, but this time because of the combination of synonymy and ambiguity in `small_lexicon`. There are two ways of expressing referent 0, which in itself isn't necessarily a problem - you can construct a toy lexicon where every referent has several words associated with it and where perfect communication is posisble. But in `small_lexicon` one of the synonymous forms, word2, is ambiguous; as a result, the literal speaker will often use word2 to label referent 0, and when that happens the literal listener is unlikely to arrive at the correct interpretation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Some but not all of these problems are reduced for pragmatic speakers and listeners. In particular, the pragmatic speaker is aware of the ambiguity of word2, and as a result tends to avoid it when other options are available (i.e. for referent 0, where word1 is a better option). For referents 1 and 2 they have no choice to but to use the highly ambiguous word2, because they have no other means available for expressing those referents. But the pragmatic listener can reduce the ambiguity a little, because they know that the pragmatic speaker has a better way of expressing referent 0, so word2 becomes effectively 2-and-a-bit-ways ambiguous. Note that it's not magic though - in particular, the problems posed by ambiguity are reduced, but not eliminated.*"

    "4. [Hard] Our `s0` and `s1` functions are models of how a (literal or pragmatic) speaker would speak given a particular lexicon: in other words, it's modelling a likelihood, p(data|lexicon), where data is a pairing of intended referents and words. Think about how you could use this as the basis for a model of word learning where the learner's task is to infer an entire lexicon based on the productions of a speaker using that lexicon (Hint: to do this you need to decide what the hypothesis space is and what the prior is). Is learning easier or harder when you learn from a literal or pragmatic speaker? If you are feeling brave, implement the model, otherwise have a think about what kinds of challenges a learner learning from a pragmatic speaker might face when it comes to inferring the \"correct\" (i.e. same as the teacher's) word meanings."

You could just use a uniform prior, but we'll see in the next lab (when we model compositionality) that actually thinking about things like the complexity of the lexicon (how many distinct forms does it use?) makes sense in these cases.*"

    "*I haven't provided an implementation of this full model, but just thinking about it: one of the challenges facing a learner who learns from pragmatic speakers is that the way they use words doesn't reflect their **real** meaning, which might meake it hard for learners to figure out what that real meaning is. For instance, in the `small_lexicon` example above, both the speaker and listener thing that word2 refers to referents 0, 1 and 2, but in practice when they use the word they tend to avoid using it for referent 0. As a result, and based on a small sample of observations of this behaviour, a learner might learn the wrong meaning for word2, namely `{1,2}`. That's the wrong thing to do if your goal is to infer the same lexicon as the person generating your data, but it does suggest that, if combined with iterated learning, this might work nicely as a model of language change where initial pragmatic flexibility becomes lixicalised/grammaticalised, resulting in changes in the meaning of words or expressions.*"
